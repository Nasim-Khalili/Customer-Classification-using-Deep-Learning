# Customer Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to classify customers as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on financial history data. The model uses a simple feedforward neural network (ANN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Uses a neural network with two hidden layers.
- Implements dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Standardizes input data for better performance.
- Trains using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-classification.git
   cd customer-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to train the model:
```bash
python customer_classification.py
```

## Dataset
- The dataset is randomly generated for demonstration purposes.
- Replace it with real financial transaction data for better results.

## Model Evaluation
After training, the script prints the test accuracy:
```bash
Test Accuracy: 0.85 (example output)
```

## Future Improvements
- Use real financial data.
- Implement more advanced architectures (e.g., LSTM for sequential data).
- Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearch.
